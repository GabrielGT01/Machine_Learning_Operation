# Machine Learning Operations (MLOps)

## Overview

This repository demonstrates best practices and tools that bring together machine learning (ML), DevOps, and data engineering to automate and streamline the deployment, monitoring, and maintenance of ML models in production environments.

## What is MLOps?

MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) is a set of practices that aims to deploy and maintain machine learning models in production reliably and efficiently. It combines machine learning, DevOps, and data engineering to create a unified approach for the entire ML lifecycle.

## Repository Purpose

The aim of this repository is to provide:

- **Practical Examples**: Real-world implementations of MLOps practices  
- **Tool Demonstrations**: Showcasing various tools and technologies used in MLOps  
- **Best Practices**: Guidelines for implementing MLOps in production environments  
- **Automation Workflows**: Examples of CI/CD pipelines for ML models  
- **Monitoring Solutions**: Techniques for model performance monitoring and maintenance  

## Key MLOps Components to Be Covered

### 1. Model Development & Training

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering  
- Model training and validation  
- Experiment tracking and versioning  
- Model registry and artifact management  

### 2. Deployment & Serving

- Model containerization with Docker  
- API endpoint creation and management with Flask  

### 3. Monitoring & Maintenance

- Model performance monitoring with Evidently AI  
- Data drift detection  

### 4. Testing

- Unit testing with `pytest`  
- Monitoring test metrics with Evidently AI  

### 5. Infrastructure & Orchestration

- Infrastructure as Code (IaC)  
- Workflow orchestration  
- Resource management and scaling  
- Security and compliance considerations  

### 6. CI/CD

- GitHub Actions for automation of testing and deployment  

## Technologies & Tools

This repository includes examples and implementations using:

- **Containerization**: Docker  
- **Orchestration**: Apache Airflow, MLflow  
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack, Evidently AI  
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions  
- **Cloud Platforms**: AWS, GCP, Azure  
- **Model Serving**: Flask, MLflow
